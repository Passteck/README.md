# 👨‍💻 Passteck — JavaScript Developer & Linux Enthusiast

Hi there, I’m **Passteck**, a JavaScript developer with a strong passion for open-source technologies and minimalist, efficient workflows. I build web applications with a focus on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability — all from my daily driver: **Kubuntu 25.04**.

My development style is pragmatic and structured, fueled by curiosity and the desire to deliver clean, functional code that solves real-world problems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS  
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Exploring as needed — always choosing tools that serve the project, not the hype  
- **Development Environment**: Kubuntu 25.04 (KDE Plasma, terminal-friendly, highly customizable)  
- **Other Tools**: Git, Node.js, VS Code, Bash

## 🎯 What I’m Into

I enjoy working on well-structured, open-source projects with a clear purpose and thoughtful architecture. I value collaboration, code readability, and learning through real-world challenges.

> “Clean code speaks for itself. A great developer also knows how to listen to the system.”
